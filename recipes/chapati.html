    <h3>Kenyan chapati</h3>
    <p>Recipe: Kenyan Chapati
        Kenyan Chapati is a soft, flaky, chewy flatbread that is a staple part of celebratory meals in Kenya and other East African Countries. Popularly known as “chapo” in Kenya, it is usually enjoyed with curries as a main meal, with tea or eggs for breakfast.
        
        Kenyan Chapati is not the same as the Indian chapati. Indian chapati is also known as roti in many parts of India. Kenyan Chapati is more like the flaky parathas.</p>

                Some Vital Tips To Make Soft Flaky Kenyan Chapati
<li>Don’t reduce the amount of oil/ghee/fat required. The correct amount of fat is what makes them flaky.</li>
<li>Kenyan Chapati are mostly made from plain/all purpose flour and not the wheat flour we use for Indian roti or parathas.</li>
<li>Don’t omit the amount of sugar added to the dough. It lands a distinct flavour the the flatbread.</li>
<li>Allow the dough to rest often to make it more pliable.</li>
<li>Must add fat to the dough to make it soft.</li>
<li>Folding of rolled out dough varies. Use the one which you are most comfortable with. I prefer the fan folding method.</li>
<li>For soft chapati especially if you’re serving with a curry, don’t cook or roast it too much. Soft chapati allows one to tear it easily and pick up curry with it.
I usually prefer a more crispy variety if I am using it for rolex recipe or serving it with tea. Kenyan Chapati dunked in ginger tea is so delicious. For the more crispy variety, cook or roast it a bit more over medium heat. Rolex is a popular Ugandan Street Food whereby an omelette and chapati are cooked together and rolled up.</li>
