    <p>Some Vital Tips To Make Soft Flaky Kenyan Chapati
        Don’t reduce the amount of oil/ghee/fat required. The correct amount of fat is what makes them flaky.
        Kenyan Chapati are mostly made from plain/all purpose flour and not the wheat flour we use for Indian roti or parathas.
        Don’t omit the amount of sugar added to the dough. It lands a distinct flavour the the flatbread.
        Allow the dough to rest often to make it more pliable.
        Must add fat to the dough to make it soft.
        Folding of rolled out dough varies. Use the one which you are most comfortable with. I prefer the fan folding method.
        For soft chapati especially if you’re serving with a curry, don’t cook or roast it too much. Soft chapati allows one to tear it easily and pick up curry with it.
        I usually prefer a more crispy variety if I am using it for rolex recipe or serving it with tea. Kenyan Chapati dunked in ginger tea is so delicious. For the more crispy variety, cook or roast it a bit more over medium heat. Rolex is a popular Ugandan Street Food whereby an omelette and chapati are cooked together and rolled up.

            <li>1 teaspoon saffron</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon bay leaf</li>
            
        </ol></p>
        <p>Steps <ol>
            <li> Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies
                To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, firstly soak saffron in water to prepare saffron water (one tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water). Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra water. Set them aside for later usage. Now, chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.</li>
                <li> Saute the onions
                    Meanwhile, heat refined oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. Then, add chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3 minutes. Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and patted dry before adding it to the dish)</li>
                    <li> Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes
                        Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and 1 tsp saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender. Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add the remaining saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the dish without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.</li>
                        <li>Serve hot chicken biryani with your favourite chutney or raita
                            Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp fried onions and coriander leaves. Serve hot chicken biryani with raita of your choice. Enjoy!</li>
